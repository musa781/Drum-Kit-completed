# Drum-Kit-completed
A Drum Kit is an interactive web application that mimics a real drum set using a graphical user interface. When the user clicks on buttons or presses specific keys, it plays corresponding drum sounds (e.g., snare, kick, tom, hi-hat). It's a popular beginner project for learning JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
